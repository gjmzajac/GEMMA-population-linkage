PROGRAM: GEMMA with Population Linkage

AUTHOR: Xiang Zhou, Gregory Zajac

YEAR: 2012, 2020

DESCRIPTION: This program is largely based on the GEMMA v0.96 
(Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association) 
<https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA> package by Xiang Zhou but 
has been modified to implement the Population Linkage method developed by 
Gregory Zajac and Gon√ßalo Abecasis at the University of Michigan for 
performing genome-wide linkage analysis on a population cohort. This
implementation expects kinship and IBD inferred in KING
<http://people.virginia.edu/~wc9c/KING/manual.html>

This repository also contains two helpful tools k_cov_pheno for simulating
a phenotype with covariance from a kinship matrix and extract_chr_ends to
make a kinship matrix based on the the ends of chromosomes, and an R script
to make a LOD plot and other plots.

USAGE: all GEMMA usage applies. To run Population Linkage:
```
./gemma \
    -bfile [prefix] \
    -k [filename] \
    -segments [KING IBD segments.gz filename] \
    -km [num] -n [num] -vc 1 \
    -outdir [output directory] \
    -o [output prefix]
```

replace -k with -mk to use multiple kinship files, -king for a KING kinship 
file, or -seg for a KING seg file. Optionally, set -max-link-tests [num] to
limit the number of tests and speed up the analysis.

To combine multiple kinship files based on a VC fit for a phenotype:
```
./gemma \
    -bfile [prefix] \
    -mk [filename] \
    -combine-mats -km [num] -n [num] -vc 1 \
    -outdir [output directory] \
    -o [output prefix]
```

DOCUMENTATION: A detailed user manual (for GEMMA, not Population Linkage) 
is available online and a recent version is provided inside the doc 
directory. A brief description is also available if you type "./gemma -h". 
Please refer to the online user manual for updated information.

INSTALLATION: An executable binary (x86 64bit Linux) is available in
the bin directory. No installation is necessary if the executable
works in your system. Otherwise, see compilation section below.

COMPILATION: You will need a standard C/C++ compiler such as GNU gcc,
as well as GSL, LAPACK libraries. You will need to change the library
paths in the Makefile accordingly.
